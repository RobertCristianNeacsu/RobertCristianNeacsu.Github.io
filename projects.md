Here are some projects and things done for school.

# Programming 3 Project: Quiz Application

For our Programming 3 project, we had to create a simple quiz application using XAML. It was a group project done in teams of 2. The app would work by loading a text file with four questions and an answer in separate lines.

The format for the text file is as follows:

>1. Answer 1
>2. Answer 2
>3. Answer 3
>4. Answer 4
>5. Answer from above 4

This can be repeated as much as the user would like in order to have more questions.

# Application Development Project: Budget Application

Throughout the majority of our first Application Development class, we worked in groups on a budget application. This project was done during the majority of our semester. We had numerous sprints with many different requirements for this project. The app works by either creating or loading an existing database from a file and adding or modifying the data.

Other capabilities of the app include customizing the colors, searching for specific expenses by category, date, or even just something more specific with the search bar at the top. the expenses can also be modified by left-clicking on the grid, or right-clicking, which will bring up a menu.
