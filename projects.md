Here are some projects and things done for school.

# Programming 3 Project: Quiz Application

For our Programming 3 project, we had to create a simple quiz application using XAML. It was a group project done in teams of 2. The app would work by loading a text file with four questions and an answer in separate lines.

# Application Development Project: Budget Application

Throughout the majority of our first Application Development class, we worked in groups on a budget application. We had numerous sprints with many different requirements for this project. The app works by either creating or loading an existing database from a file and adding or modifying the data thanks to the app.
